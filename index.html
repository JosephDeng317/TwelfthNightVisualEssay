            <p class="opensans">
                Twelfth Night is a Shakespearean play that falls under the categories of romance and comedy. 
                Although it is more of a lighthearted piece, there still are some serious motifs that can be picked out from it, with one of them being fake identity.
                There are multiple examples of people hiding under fake identities which show that many people do certain things, not for themselves, but to seek validation or acceptance from others.

                            Viola wants to serve Orsino but she can’t since she’s a woman. 
                            To overcome this, she has to hide under a male identity so that she could be accepted in Orsino’s court. 
                            This shows that sometimes society places restrictions on certain groups of people that may not be completely fair, which then forces people to create fake identities in order to accomplish what they want.

                            And when I was younger <br>
                            I knew a boy and a boy <br>
                            Best friends with each other <br>
                            But always wished they were more <br>
                            'Cause they loved one another <br>
                            But never discovered <br>
                            'Cause they were too afraid of what they'd say <br>

                        <p class='opensans medbigtext'>
                            These lyrics from the song describe 2 closeted gay friends that wanted to be together, but couldn’t  because society wouldn’t accept them for it. 
                            This shows that even today, groups of people have to pretend to be someone else to avoid consequences. 
                            Although it has gotten better over the years, many parts of the world still discriminate against LGBTQ people which forces many of its members to hide or even try to change the sexuality they were born with.

                            His actions show that people love to be validated by other people, and they will go to great lengths to get this validation. 
                            This can lead to people living in facades, or even pretending to be someone else altogether if they think their unfiltered self isn’t good enough.

                            This song perfectly shows how materialistic society has become and how many people are living fictional lives online just to seek validation from others.

                        Despite its age, many Shakespearean plays still hold valuable lessons that can be applied in the 21st century, Twelfth Night is no exception. 
                        Much can be learned about how people build fictional identities and why they want to do so in the first place.
